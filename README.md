   Emotion based Music Recommendation System.
    It to recommend music by  detecting person  emotion/current mood .
So, basically what this system does is that it will recognize a user's emotion/mood by image processing/ video processing and based on that it will play the music which is best to listen for that user in such a mental state.

The humans make use of facial expressions to express more clearly what they want to say and the context in which they meant their words.
By developing this recommendation system it could assist a user to make a decision regarding which music one should listen to helping the user to reduce their stress levels. 
The user would not have to waste any time in searching or to look up. The image of the user is taken with a webcam.
The image will be taken to recognize the person's mood/emotion of the user and an appropriate song from the playlist of the user is shown matching the userâ€™s requirement.
